    <p>
        While we love practically any kind of breakfast, 
        there's a special place in our hearts for this Mexican-style scrambled egg dish.
        Migas, which means "crumbs" in Spanish, is a dish of leftovers. 
        Take a few of the tortillas you didn't use for last night's tacos, 
        and mix them with a bit of the leftover chorizo. Scramble in some eggs, and top them with whatever 
        toppings you still have on hand.  
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz. fresh chorizo, casings removed</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. oil</li>
        <li>2 corn tortillas, torn or cut into strips</li>
        <li>4 eggs, well beaten</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook chorizo in a large skillet over medium heat, breaking it into pieces, 
            until browned and cooked through, 
            5 to 7 minutes. Remove chorizo, with a slotted spoon, reserving oil. 
            Add 1 tablespoon oil (you want about 2 tablespoons total in the skillet) and tortillas to skillet. 
            Cook, without stirring, until crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Return chorizo to skillet. Add eggs and season with salt and pepper. As eggs begin to set, 
            scrape mixture into center of pan with a heatproof spatula
        </li>
        <li>
            Just before eggs are fully cooked, remove pan from heat. Divide mixture among 4 plates, 
            and garnish with avocado, tomatoes, and sour cream or queso, dividing evenly. Serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
